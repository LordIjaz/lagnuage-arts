<h1>What ICHS offers </h1>
<p>physical education is one of the favourites when it comes to creative subjects. Your child will be participating in pe lessons twice per week,this routine will continuously happen until year 10,</p> <p>
    in year 9 your son will have the opportunity to either pick gcse pe as their one creative subject OR they do not pick it for gcse's. You may be thinking gcse peis practically useless but in reality... ITS NOT!With gcse pe your child can unlock several different job oportunites that give high pay!</p><p>
        Your child could potentially become a sports coach,earning millions of pounds every month or even could get into something related with science.The difference ichs makes compared to other schools is that we encouragre our pupils to follow a path in something they enjoy and like, We do not beleive that kids should just focus on core subjects such as maths science and english, to justify our beleifs we nly select the top level of pe teachers that support and give well structure advice to not just your child, but you aswell! After knowing that there is a guarantee that your child will be suported no matter what they want to do, still not considering sending your child to ichs is ludicrous! </p>
<p>What are school offers- French, German and Spanish.
At ICHS, depending on what house you are assigned to, you will be studying French Spanish or German. If you are Eagles, you learn French. Hawks house learns Spanish and Falcons house learns German. This will continue onto GCSEs where your assigned language will be what language you do for the exam.

Our school also offers websites and software for free for students, some being LanguageNut and LanguageGym. These software are very good and will help you on your learning journey
